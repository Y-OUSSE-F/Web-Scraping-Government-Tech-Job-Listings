# Web-Scraping-Government-Tech-Job-Listings

At work in my role as a Business Operations Analyst, to drive an internal project my team and I were working on, we had to collect data on what sorts of tech roles government hires for. I used these scripts to put together databases based on goverment jobs in NYC and at the federal level.

This repository is meant to be a base for my colleagues, as well as anyone looking for a scraping template, to work off of to scrape other sites on an as needed basis. You can also use the scripts provided here to scrape other adjacent sites for data that is more specifically suited to your needs. For my purposes, you will see in the code I exported static .csv files for further manipulation in excel, which is why in the final output, text spacing from the sites I was scraping comes out in the tabular pandas input.  I hope my code provides you with a good base to begin scraping away!

All work was done on my own computer and files were downloaded locally for work privacy reasons. I have formatted these in a guide template to make them as easily digestible for the seasoned data scientist, newbies and anyone in the range in between like myself. Depending on when you are viewing this repository, these specific notebooks may need tweaking if the specific sites have been updated since. You should have a basic understanding of HTML to be able to adapt these for your own purposes. Thanks for looking around!
