# Web-Scraping-Government-Tech-Job-Listings

At work in my role as a Business Operations Analyst, to drive an internal project my team and I were working on, we had to collect data on what sorts of tech roles government hires for. I used these scripts to put together databases based on goverment jobs in NYC and at the federal level.

This repository is meant to be a base for my colleagues, as well as anyone looking for a scraping template, to work off of to scrape other sites on an as needed basis. You can also use the scripts provided here to scrape other adjacent sites for data that is more specifically suited to your needs. I hope my code provides you with a good base to begin scraping away!

All work was done on my own computer and files were downloaded locally for work privacy reasons. Thanks for looking around!
